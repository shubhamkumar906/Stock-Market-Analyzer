                <h4>Facts About Stock Markets</h4>
                <p>1.	In India, out of 22124.14 INR billion household savings, only 2% goes as investment into equities. People in India are more inclined to invest their money in gold, banks and in real estate.<br>
•	If we calculate in terms of percentage who directly invest in stock market, it’s less than 1% of total population and if we calculate direct and indirect both, it may reach to 2 to 3% only.<br>
•	Indirectly means investments through Mutual funds, LICs and other similar investments available in India.<br>
•	Whereas in 2020, 55 percent of adults in the United States invested in the stock market and is still below the levels before the Great Recession, when it peaked in 2007 at 65 percent.<br><br>

2.	 World’s most expensive stock is of Warren Buffett’s company – Berkshire Hathaway (Class A).<br>
One stock of Berkshire Hathaway costs 284,900 USD (on 30 November’2017), which is equivalent to Rs 1.85 crores (over 2 crores currently). 
How many stocks are you planning to buy? :) 


3.	Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is the biggest stock exchange in the world in terms of the number of listed companies on an exchange. BSE has over 5,500 listed companies.<br>
 BSE is also the oldest stock exchange in Asia. It was established in 1875.<br><br>

4.	World’s oldest stock exchange was established in the year 1602 called Amsterdam stock exchange. 
It was established by Dutch East India company and offered printed stocks and bonds.<br><br>


5.	The Bull And The Bear Market<br>
 
The bull and bear market is the most commonly used term in the stock market. The caballeros put California grizzlies/bears in battle with bulls. They observed bears swiped downward and bulls hooked upward, thus lending the analogy. <br>
•	When the stock price is appreciating, and the overall mood of the market is positive, it is known as the bull market. It is also believed that the bull has its horns pointed towards the sky, which symbolizes the upward movement. Thus, the bull market is related to the climbing market.<br>
•	On the other hand, the market where the overall sentiment of the market is negative, and the stock price has been declining, it is known as the bear market. It is often believed that the bear when tackling the bull has its palm towards the ground, and thus bear market resembles a declining market<br><br>

6.	There is total of 23 stock exchanges in India.
 How many do you know apart from BSE and NSE?<br>
•	There are 23 stock exchanges in India. Among them, two are national level stock exchanges namely BSE and NSE. The rest 21 are Regional Stock Exchanges (RSE).<br>
•	Due to stringent norms introduced by SEBI, 20 RSEs in the country opted to exit the business.<br>
•	Pune Stock Exchange closed in 2015.<br><br>




7.	Do you know Rule of 72?<br>
•	The rule is a simple way of determining how much time will an investment take to double given a fixed annual rate of interest.<br>
•	By dividing 72 by the rate of return, an investor may get an estimate on how many years it will take for the initial investment to double itself.<br>
•	Assume you are investing Rs 5,00,000 at 8% returns, then as per rule of 72, it would take nine years for the amount to double (72/8= 9).<br>

8.	An Indian Company More Prominent Than The Combined Market Value Of The Karachi Stock Exchange
Shocking right?
Can you name the Indian company with the largest market capitalisation?<br><br>

9.	There is a ‘pirate stock exchange’ in Somalia where locals can invest in pirate gangs planning hijacking missions.<br>
•	Apart from stocks and commodities, there is a pirate exchange, as well. There is no authentic report available on the operations, but sources mentioned that over 70 entities are listed on the exchange<br>
•	The world's first pirate stock exchange was established in 2009 in Harardheere in Somalia, The exchange is open round the clock and allows investors to profit from ransoms collected.<br><br>




10.	When master blaster used to play international cricket, his dismissal adversely affected the Indian stock market.<br>
 
Nifty index was generally flat the day after India wins a match, but the day following a loss, the index dropped by an average of 0.231%. When Sachin Tendulkar is on the losing side, the loss on the stock market is almost 20% more. <br><br>



     11.  The costliest share in the Indian share market is MRF. <br>
•	Madras Rubber Factory (MRF)  has the highest share price in India among all the listed companies on BSE/NSE. It costs almost Rs 60,000 to buy 1 share of MRF.<br>
•	Rs 11 to Rs 54,000 in 26 years! This stock had made patient investors crorepati.<br>
•	MRF shares have generated multi fold returns for the investors over the years. If an investor had invested Rs 1 lakh in MRF shares 25 years ago, the corpus would have been worth Rs 74.02 crore in April 30, 2018 when the stock was its peak.<br>
•	The all-time high share price of MRF is Rs 81,426. The stock is currently trading at a standalone PE of 21.19.<br><br>
 
 11.	 September and October in Stock Market<br>
•	On average, the market performs the poorest in September. <br>
•	Since 1950, the Dow has declined 1.1% and the S&P 500 has declined 0.7% on average during the month of September.<br>
•	Since the NASDAQ was created in 1971, its composite index has fallen an average of 1% in September. Historically, on an average the market declines mostly in the month of September.<br>
•	The three leading indicator DJIA (Dow Jones), S&P 500 (Standard and Poor) and NASDAQ have seemed to be performing poorly in this month. <br>
•	One of the reasons for this is that the trading volume declines in summer as the investors take time for vacation and once they return to work, they exit positions they had build up.<br>
•	October is considered as the jinxed month as the two worst stock market crashes in history occurred in this month. The first occurred in 1929 with a 25 percent declined in the share prices, and by 1932 the value of shares was just 20% of the value of shares in 1929! The next crash occurred in 1987 October when the stock market declined by one fourth!<br><br>

12.	Australia has had the best performing share market in the world from 1900 to 2009.<br>
•	Australia posted 7.5% after-inflation returns per year during that time, making those returns the highest (with volatility the second lowest) of the 19 major markets the researchers studied.<br>
•	From 1980 to 2010, $10,000 would be worth…* $234,319 in Australian shares, a return of 11.1% per annum.<br>

                <h4>A glaring paradox of modern economics</h4>
                <p>When the world economy is sinking due to the Covid19 pandemic shutdown, stock markets (capital markets) are booming thus allowing those at the top of the economic pyramid make wealth when billions of people are losing theirs.<br>
The global economy was facing its worst recession since World War II and that the growth was expected to shrink (i.e. negative growth) by 5.2% in 2021(as said by World Bank in its 'Global Economic Prospects' report of June 2020). 
It should also be noted out that the major fraction of economies are experiencing a reduction in per capita output.
<br><br>
The US economy is projected to shrink by 6.1% in 2020 and that of India by 3.2% in FY21. (Most developed economies, including the US, count their fiscal years from January 1 to December 31; India counts its fiscal year from April to March and hence the difference in marking the current year).
Yet the harsh reality has ignored stock markets, except for an initial blip in March.
<br><br>
Stock market booms while economy sinks
The analysis of stock market data says that the US billionaire wealth surged to $584 billion, or 20%, during the pandemic, between March 18 (rough starting date of the pandemic lockdown) and June 17, when most economic activities were restricted.<br>
The report, which analysed stock market performance, said during the same time, 45.5 million Americans had filed for unemployment. In the first quarter (January to March 2020) $6.5 trillion in household wealth had vanished.
The US GDP registered negative growth 4.8% in the first quarter, the first negative reading since Q1 of 2014.<br>
Scrutiny of stock market data shows, between mid-March and mid-June the US's NASDAQ(National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) Composite rose by 41.8% and the S&P 500 - the top 500 stocks - went up 27%.
<br><br>
A similar situation is evident in India
Business Today magazine's latest issue (July 12, 2020) provides startling information. Describing the market rallies during the pandemic lockdown as "a lot of bull", it drew attention to three things: <br>
⦁	India's economy is projected to shrink (negative) 6.8% in FY21, 	according to the SBI's projections (World Bank projected a 	shrink by 3.2%) <br>
⦁	growth in Q4 of FY20 was slowest in 11 years at 3.1% and <br>
⦁	early corporate results showing sharply shrinking top lines and bottom lines.<br>
Just as it happened in the US, the Indian stock market has rallied through the lockdown after an initial dip in March, driven by a handful of stocks. Between March 23 (national lockdown started from midnight of March 24-25) and June 12, 10 stocks accounted for 75% of the rise.
<br><br>
The current stock market rally is not an isolated incident.
Sensex hit an all all-time high of 42,063 on January 17, 2020, while quarterly growth rate had consistently been going down since Q4 of FY18 when it touched 8.1% and went down to 3.1% in Q4 of FY20.<br>
The stock market rally until Q4 of FY20 is all the more perplexing since the GDP numbers are known to be grossly exaggerated due to multiple downward revisions of previous quarter numbers, thereby making subsequent numbers look better than what they are.
Such downward revision goes all the way to the UPA era (FY05 to FY14). Yet, the Sensex reached an all-time high of 42,063 on January 17, 2020.<br>
Post-March rally has happened even though the lockdown has hit the economy hard and growth for at least the next two quarters is expected to be negative (first-quarter numbers will come out in August).<br>
The SBI's growth projection for FY21 (Ecowrap of May 26, 2020) maybe -6.8% but its projection for Q1 FY21 is massively negative at (-) 45%.
<br><br>
What is then driving the stock markets?
<br>
Disconnect from business fundamentals
<br>
Did the delinking happen now?
<br>
It has been pointed out that the Indian stock markets had discounted massive economic shocks of demonetisation and GST that derailed the economy in 2017, and bank failures (PMC, Yes Bank), NBFC crisis (IL&FS, DHFL) and growing NPAs in the subsequent years that prevented the economy from bouncing back.<br>
The upward trend in the stock markets continues amidst the trade war against China. Amid rising clamour to boycott Chinese goods, imports from China have been held up at Indian ports, which the Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Industries Nitin Gadkari objected to saying that this will harm local businesses that have already paid for these goods.
Far more critical is that such hold-ups may impact the production of key COVID-19 drugs remdesivir and favipiravir and other life-saving drugs in India, leading to country-wide shortage and endangering the lives of millions of Indians. India imports two-thirds of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and formulations from China.<br><br>
Some economy experts suggest that the delinking of stock markets happened in recent times (2015). But this delinking was evident during the massive market crash of 2008 and earlier in 2000-01 when the dotcom burst happened. Historically, this break down has been evident since the 1929 Great Depression. That is nearly a hundred years of historical evidence.<br>
It needs no elaboration that high stock market fluctuation comes up when the link with the real economy (macroeconomic and business fundamentals) is broken. Valuation of stocks reaches irrational highs, leading to an eventual crash (unless timely rescued with taxpayers' money).
<br><br>
Reason for the market boom
<br>
Why stock markets are booming when economies are not performing well is not unknown.
For one, it has a great deal to do with liquidity infusion.
In the US, the Federal Reserve has not only reduced interest rate to near zero (0.25%) to create more liquidity but also decided, as part of its stimulus, to buy corporate bonds from open market (quantitative easing). 
<br><br>
There is more support waiting. Should there be a market crash, more taxpayers' money would be ploughed in to protect private investors, as happened during the Great Recession of 2007-08.
In India, it happens even without massive crashes of the 2007-08 proportion.
It is no secret that every time market falls sharply, the government instructs public sector undertakings like the LIC and SBI to step in quickly, buy stocks and boost "market sentiment". That this rush job is potentially dangerous for these PSUs escapes attention.
For another, it is the lure of gambling. Making quick money through speculative activities (betting and gambling) is an old human vice.
But lowering the interest rate to near zero in the US further incentivises people to borrow money virtually free of cost to invest in stock markets. This is one reason why the US stock market has made a swift recovery.<br><br>
Stock traders know the Fed will protect the long-term profitability of big corporations with taxpayers' money.
In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been reducing interest rates. Though it has not reached near zero yet (repo rate is 4%), it has generated additional liquidity of Rs 8.1 lakh crore. Most of it is being parked in the RBI's reverse repo account, reflecting the futility of liquidity infusion. On June 26, Rs 6.35 lakh crore was parked in this account. On many occasions in May, the reverse repo deposits had crossed the Rs 8 lakh crore mark.
<br><br>
Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has been stinging in his criticism of the speculative activities in stock markets.
In the book 'People, Power and Profits', Stiglitz writes: "In many ways, the stock market is just a rich person's casino. 
And while gambling may afford some short-term pleasure, money simply moves from one person's pocket to another. 
The gambling - and short-term trading - don't make the country richer or more productive, and it often ends in bitter tears on the part of one party or the other."
<br><br>
To that extent, stock market activities are simply a tool to transfer money from impatient to the patient or a zero-sum game in which some gain at the cost of others. 
Why does the game never end at some point?
Apart from low-interest money, more people join the game, bringing in fresh money to keep the game going.
